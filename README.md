# trail-pathfinding
This program takes in a data file and then generates a .pgm file representing an elevation map. 
It then generates another .pgm representing a trail through the lowest elevations.
This is accomplished through the use of a greedy algorithm.


For debugging, I've also included generateRandom.c, which generates a random data file which can be used to test the algorithm.
